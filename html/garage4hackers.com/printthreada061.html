		<blockquote class="restore">Hello All, I would like to know views on whether there are any career prospects available in VA/PT, exploit research etc at senior level? In most cases I have seen, companies hire people having 1-3 years experience for conducting VA/PT (mostly because it costs them less and automated tools are available for scanning). But what I would like to know is what are the possible opportunities for experienced people say having around 7 years of experience into security. What profiles exist at senior levels related to VA/PT? Also I am not very sure about scope for such opportunities at senior level since (atleast in many companies in India) a senior security guy is expected to look after all the compliance and not just VA/PT. Also what certifications would be ideal for such profiles? CEH and ECSA/LPT are easy to get and may not really prove core hacking skills... OSCP from Offensive Security looks certainly better.<br/>
Any views/suggestions/recommendations on above would be appreciated....</blockquote>

<br/>
I see mix and match of that among my friend circle. Few with 7-8 years of work experience are doing VA/PT only and some covers compliance + VA/PT. All drawing good packages. <br/>
But being just into VA/PT demands more skills and research kind of work from individuals and that is justified. VA/PT guys (7-8 years exp) skills definitely has to be much above than somebody doing VA/PT for 1-3 years or from his peer whoz doing compliance as well. Team lead positions are good fit for such profiles. <br/>
And if somebody gotta good core technical skills, name in market, good social and professional circle, opportunities are always there for him.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding certificates - I am not going to get in debate for them, we already have few thread dedicated to them.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</blockquote>
