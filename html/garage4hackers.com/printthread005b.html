Its in everybody's mind,however being an entreprenuer is not all about security knowledge.....its about experience in the field,client management,understanding the market,compeitive delivery techniques,investment etc....<br/>

Our own IDS/IPS web-application based , Automatic Discovery of Malware Signature ..this can our start .. (PS: I don't thing member in g4h who don't know how to work on this stuff if not Beginner will get chance to learn new tech Era. )  in coming year we can have our own employee :D this is my thinking  ..</blockquote>

		<div class="title">One of the secrets behind getting a job in Sec - for freshers</div>
	
	<div class="content">
		<blockquote class="restore">Freshers, try to understand the following scenario:<br/>
<br/>
Most of the jobs in Sec field even do not come to job portals. The get filled by reference from some of their own employees. Especially, the jobs demanding experience from 0-3 years.<br/>
<br/>
Now let say XYZ company asks his employee Mr. Rock, who has a good reputation in office, to get someone with 0-3 years of experience on board. <br/>
<br/>
So what do you (freshers) think how he would approach?<br/>
<br/>
First of all he'll try listing out all of the "deserving" fresh guys who are in touch with him or he knows are good. If he finds someone worthy looking for job, he would refer him for the opening.<br/>
If failed to do so, he'll contact all his friends who are into the same domain to check in their contacts to find someone.<br/>
If failed to find anyone, job would be posted on some job portal.<br/>
<br/>
So the very important question is, how would Mr. Rock judge whether some one is good enough to perform the job or not?<br/>
<br/>
Ans: The valuable presence of the fresher in the communities or forums which Mr. Rock frequently visits. <br/>
With the valuable presence what I mean is....show/share your knowledge politely on forums. <br/>
Let others see your arsenal<br/>
Let others see what you are capable of doing<br/>
Let others see how you interact with your peers<br/>
Let others see how you respect your seniors, peers and followers<br/>
Let others see your positive attitude and desire to learn new stuff<br/>
Let others see your passion for hacking and willingness to make Security as your career<br/>
<br/>
If Mr. Rock doesn't see the above mentioned points, how would he come to know about the right candidate?<br/>
<br/>
The scenario ends here and I believe I made my point clear.<br/>
<br/>
With sharing you not only get in contact with good guys but directly serving the hackers community as well from where you learnt everything and for absolutely free!<br/>
<br/>
<b>So sharing is caring and an indirect help to your self.</b><br/>
<br/>
