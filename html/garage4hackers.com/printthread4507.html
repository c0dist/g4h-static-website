<br/>
Cloud computing is a relatively new way of referring to the use of shared computing resources,<br/>
and it is an alternative to having local servers handle applications. Cloud computing groups<br/>
together large numbers of compute servers and other resources and typically offers their<br/>
combined capacity on an on-demand, pay-per-cycle basis. The end users of a cloud computing<br/>
network usually have no idea where the servers are physically located—they just spin up their<br/>
application and start working.<br/>
Cloud computing is fully enabled by virtualization technology (hypervisors) and virtual<br/>
appliances. A virtual appliance is an application that is bundled with all the components that it<br/>
needs to run, along with a streamlined operating system. In a cloud computing environment, a<br/>
virtual appliance can be instantly provisioned and decommissioned as needed, without complex<br/>
configuration of the operating environment.<br/>
This flexibility is the key advantage to cloud computing, and what distinguishes it from other<br/>
forms of grid or utility computing and software as a service (SaaS). The ability to launch new<br/>
instances of an application with minimal labor and expense allows application providers to:<br/>
• Scale up and down rapidly<br/>
• Recover from a failure<br/>
• Bring up development or test instances<br/>
• Roll out new versions to the customer base<br/>
• Efficiently load test an application<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Architectural Considerations<br/>
Designing an application to run as a virtual appliance in a cloud computing environment is very<br/>
different than designing it for an on-premise or SaaS deployment. We discuss the following<br/>
considerations. To be successful in the cloud, your application must be designed to scale easily,<br/>
tolerate failures and include management tools.<br/>
Scale<br/>
Cloud computing offers the potential for nearly unlimited scalability, as long as the application<br/>
is designed to scale from the outset. The best way to ensure this is to follow some basic application<br/>
design guidelines:<br/>
<b>Start simple</b>: Avoid complex design and performance enhancements or optimizations in favor<br/>
of simplicity. It’s a good idea to start with the simplest application and rely on the scalability<br/>
of the cloud to provide enough servers to ensure good application performance. Once you’ve<br/>
gotten some traction and demand has grown, then you can focus on improving the efficiency<br/>
of your application, which allows you to serve more users with the same number of servers<br/>
or to reduce the number of servers while maintaining performance. Some common design<br/>
techniques to improve performance include caching, server affinity, multi-threading and tight<br/>
sharing of data, but they all make it more difficult to distribute your application across many<br/>
servers. This is the reason you don’t want to introduce them at the outset and only consider<br/>
them when you need to and can ensure that you are not breaking horizontal scalability.<br/>
<b>Split application functions and couple loosely</b>: Use separate systems for different pieces of application<br/>
functionality and avoid synchronous connections between them. Again, as demand<br/>
grows, you can scale each one independently instead of having to scale the entire application<br/>
when you hit a bottleneck. The separation and reusability of functions inherent in SOA make it<br/>
an ideal architecture for the cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Network communication</b>: Design the application to use network-based interfaces and not interprocess<br/>
communication or file-based communication paradigms. This allows you to effectively<br/>
scale in the cloud because each piece of the application can be separated into distinct<br/>
systems.<br/>
<b>Consider the cluster</b>: Rather than scale a single system up to serve all users, consider splitting<br/>
your system into multiple smaller clusters, each serving a fraction of the application load. This<br/>
is often called “sharding” and many web services can be split up along one dimension, often<br/>
users or account. Requests can then be directed to the appropriate cluster based on some<br/>
request attribute or users can be redirected to a specific cluster at login. To deploy a clustered<br/>
system, determine the right collection of servers that yield efficient application performance,<br/>
taking any needed functional redundancy into account; for example, 2 web, 4 application and<br/>
2 database servers. You can then scale the application by replicating the ideal cluster size and<br/>
splitting the system load across the servers in the clusters.<br/>
You’ll soon realize the advantages of cloud computing when it comes to scalability, such as:<br/>
• <b>Inexpensive testing </b>- testing can be done against a test cluster without risking the performance<br/>
or integrity of the production system. You can also test the upper limits of the ideal<br/>
cluster’s performance by using “robot users” in the cloud to generate load.<br/>
• <b>Reduced risk</b> - bring up a test instance of the cluster to prove a new code base, and roll out a<br/>
new version one cluster at a time. Fall back to an older version if the new version doesn’t work,<br/>
without disrupting current users.<br/>
• <b>Ability to segment the customer base </b>– use clusters to separate customers with varying demands,<br/>
such as a large customer who wants a private instance of the application, or one who<br/>
requires extensive customizations.<br/>
• <b>Auto-scaling based on application load</b> – with the ready availability of resources, applications<br/>
can be built to recognize when they are reaching the limits of their current configuration and<br/>
automatically bring up new resources.<br/>
Fail<br/>
Inevitably, an application will fail, no matter what its environment. When you design an onpremise<br/>
or SaaS application, you typically consider several “doomsday” scenarios. The same<br/>
must be true for designing an application that runs in the cloud.<br/>
Build-in resiliency and fault tolerance: To tolerate failure, applications must operate as a part of<br/>
a group, while not being too tightly coupled to their peers. Each piece of the application should<br/>
be able to continue to execute despite the loss of other functions. Asynchronous interfaces are<br/>
an ideal mechanism to help application components tolerate failures or momentary unavailability<br/>
of other components.<br/>
<b>Distribute the impact of failure</b>: With a distributed cloud application, a failure in any one application<br/>
cluster affects only a portion of the application and not the whole application. By<br/>
spreading the load across multiple clusters in the cloud, you can isolate the individual clusters<br/>
against failure in another cluster.<br/>
    <br/>
<b>Get back up quickly</b>: Automate the launching of new application clusters in order to recover<br/>
quickly. Application components must be able to come up in an automated fashion, configure<br/>
themselves and join the application cluster. Cloud computing provides the ideal environment<br/>
for this fast startup and recovery process.<br/>
Data considerations: When an application fails, data persistence and system state cannot be<br/>
taken for granted. To ensure data preservation, put all data on persistent storage and make<br/>
sure it is replicated and distributed. If system state is stored and then used in the recovery<br/>
process, treat it like data so the system can be restarted from the point of failure.<br/>
Test your “doomsday” scenario: Cloud computing makes it easy to bring up an instance of your<br/>
application to test various failure scenarios. Because of the flexible nature of cloud computing,<br/>
it is possible to simulate many different failure scenarios at a very reasonable cost. Single<br/>
instances of a system can be taken off-line to see how the rest of the application will respond.<br/>
Likewise, multiple recovery scenarios can be planned and executed ahead of any real production<br/>
failure.<br/>
Be aware of the real cost of failure: Of course the ideal situation is avoiding any application<br/>
failure, but what is the cost to provide that assurance? A large internet company once said<br/>
that they could tolerate failure as long as the impact was small enough as to not be noticeable<br/>
to the overall customer base. This assertion came from an analysis of what it would cost<br/>
to ensure seven nines of application uptime versus the impact of a failure on a portion of the<br/>
customer base.<br/>
<b>Manage</b><br/>
Deploying cloud applications as virtual appliances makes management significantly easier. The<br/>
appliances should bring with them all of the software they need for their entire lifecycle in the<br/>
cloud. More important, they should be built in a systematic way, akin to an assembly line production<br/>
effort as opposed to a hand crafted approach. The reason for this systematic approach<br/>
is the consistency of creating and re-creating images. We have shown how effectively scaling<br/>
and failure recovery can be handled by rapid provisioning of new systems, but these benefits<br/>
cannot be achieved if the images to be provisioned are not consistent and repeatable.<br/>
When building appliances, it is obvious that they should contain the operating system and any<br/>
middleware components they need. Less obvious are the software packages that allow them<br/>
to automatically configure themselves, monitor and report their state back to a management<br/>
system, and update themselves in an automated fashion. Automating the appliance configuration<br/>
and updates means that as the application grows in the cloud, the management overhead<br/>
does not grow in proportion. In this way appliances can live inside the cloud for any length of<br/>
time with minimal management overhead.</blockquote>
