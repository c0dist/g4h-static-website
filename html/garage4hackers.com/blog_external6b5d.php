			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore"><span style="font-family: Courier New"><font size="3">hi guys this is my first post so please ignore any mistakes <br />
so first what is SCADA ? its abbreviated as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition so basically there are lots of hardwares in it and is used in power grids, Dams and many other industries. they use primitive softwares that are easy to exploit. remember Stuxnet that exploited Iran`s windows computer to exploit iran`s nuclear facility which was of Siemens. same way there are lots of companies who make SCADA and for ease of use and to control them from remote places they have internet connection <br />
<br />
so basically there are PLC (programmable logic contoller) which are exploited mostly. the I/O cycles are controlled by RISC (Reduced instruction set computing) processor <br />
<br />
PLCs use RISC processors to run continuous, cyclical programs and they take time in their I/O cycle to talk to the SCADA unit and receive instructions from the SCADA to modify its instruction sets or operating parameters. SCADA typically operates by evaluating the input data and determine if it is within an allowable set of parameters.<br />
<br />
1st Shodan ****** Vulnerable SCADA devices<br />
hackers know what an HTTP header does... and also that a hacker can identify that what software or authentication a server is running. with the use of that hackers find vulnerable SCADA devices. A website called <a href="http://www.shodanhq.com/" target="_blank">Shodanhq </a> does it  and makes their work easy <br />
from that a specific code(something like dorks) hackers can get lots of vulnerable SCADA devices<br />
<br />
2nd exploits <br />
SCADA exploits are hard to get :(  coz no one shares that sometimes you need to make your own but you can get some from exploit Db or there is are modules by metasploit to exploit some of them are<a href="http://www.metasploit.com/modules/exploit/windows/scada/realwin_on_fc_binfile_a" target="_blank"> here</a> or <a href="http://www.scadahacker.com/resources/msf-scada.html" target="_blank">here </a><br />

warning SCADA hacking is a very dangerous it can get people killed and lot of property damage...<br />
