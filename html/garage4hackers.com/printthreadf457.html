		<blockquote class="restore">Hey Folks,<br />
<br />
I am currently doing my Masters in Information Security @Carnegie Mellon, USA. For my full time job, I currently have two offers (both are well known security companies, teams are equally good) and confused in selecting between them. Any advice is more than welcome.  I am actually taking suggestions from few security experts and also from best communities in like NULL, so that I can make a right decision.<br />
<br />
One company work is in app security (finding vulnerabilities on web apps etc. kind of customer engagements etc.) and other is in container security (docker containers specifically. So, I need to research on the security issues  within docker or any containers and then secure their container ecosystem that they are building internally and then move that to AWS and ensure container security over there).<br />
<br />
As I said, I am not worried about team as both are equally good, what I am worried about is the future prospects. Currently, I do not see more openings for devops security / container security in any companies. Is this going to be changed soon or ....?  What do you guys suggest in terms of future prospects etc? <br />
<br />
P.S: I am just interested in security, anything related to security interests me either app sec or container sec.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">There are multiple things at stake here. you first need to take a step back and analyze the situation and also answer some of the questions.<br />
<br />
1) this is your first job.<br />
2) based on your question, i suppose potential pay is not a question.<br />
3) One company appears to be consulting firm. ideally that means, onsite opportunities, visitng different places. shorter project timeframes. also most of your work should ideally be targetting offensive work. (attack exploit and profit)<br />
4) Second company appears to be a product firm and your role seems to be more of the area dev/sec/ops. You not only attack or find flaws but you will keep working with same team trying to solve the challenges.<br />
<br />
with this in mind. try to ask some questions to yourself.<br />
<br />
1) What is it that you like in infosec. (saying everything is good will not help. do you like offense or defence.)<br />
2) Do you want to keep working with a single team and keep upgrading the level. (if they co-operate) or work on your way to get things sorted. Or on the other hand work with a team for max of a month generally a week or two and move on. may be return back to them once a six month or a year.<br />
3) option 2 is a research area, there might be more failures then sucess with option 2 are you comfortable with that. Option 1 will generally give you a weekend satisfaction that you compromised something or the other (generally its easy to find flaws if you are looking at different things every week).<br />
<br />
Ultimately it will depend on you. everyone will push their own idea's but ultimately its you who has to work and endure the environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also remember this is not a make or break decision as its your first job. Finality of your career choices generally come around year 3-4 after which it gets hard to switch roles / streams of work except moving management.<br />
<br />
And last but not the least don't ever select a job coz of the big package. initial 2-4 years what matters more is how much you learn and how much you accept that in your daily life.</blockquote>

<br />
Thank you so much for your valuable inputs. I totally agree with all of your points and they are totally valid in terms of choosing jobs.<br />
<br />
But what I am actually looking here from you guys is the prediction of container security roles in future? (I know no one can say exact things and thats the reason I asked for a &quot;prediction&quot;). Basing on the understanding that containers are growing a lot these days, do you guys think that container security roles will pop up soon in enterprises? or how do you think this will go? (I think few people must have had this kind of conversations sometime in their enterprises. For example, One of my friend whom I spoke said that they are planning to recruit a container security expert within their product security team.)<br />
<br />
As I said, I am taking opinions from so many security experts so that I can make a proper decision.</blockquote>
