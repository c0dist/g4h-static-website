iOS applications share common set of classes and highly depends on the operating system solutions for data communication, storage and encryption. Solely depending on the Apple implementation made them less complex but it affects security of the applications. Though iOS comes with a great set of security features like code signing, ASLR, DEP, sand boxing and Data Protection, all of them are subject to attack. Relying only on the iOS security could lead to demise the sensitive data stored within the application when the iOS is compromised. Application security can be improved by understanding the weaknesses in the current implementation and incorporating own code that work better.<br />
