		<blockquote class="restore">Hmm..I am not saying it is not feasible, but as a general recommendation let me tell you this: Theoretically we can do anything! Like for example , use a gigantic vibrating fork so that it matches the resonant frequency of earth and make the earth dance to our tunes. This is how it feels for somebody to read your ideas with no supporting argument in it! So next time before you suggest an idea, think about it twice and research about it thrice and post both your ideas and the supporting arguments. <br />
<br />
Ok, now coming back to your posts, manipulating hardware through code is what Stuxnet was notorious for because it used PLC code as its payload. But writing PLC code is highly complicated and varies across vendors. Also, you can't just short circuit everything, nowadays there are circuit-breakers and also , main circuitry will almost always be separated from the rest of the circuitry.<br />

		<blockquote class="restore">This is just a theory to explain I'm going to do practical(R&amp;D) and regarding the short-circuit breakers I already think about that to hijack short-circuit breaker I'm not going to directly do anything first of all I will shutdown the Security Systems(Including electricity controlling system) then intercept the calls(calls Intercepter) that are related to power then spoof calls as they are coming from power<br />
<br />
 systems and make processor believe that everything is working right then before making power systems to do voltage interference I will first shutdown the electricity control systems then as I know they will not accept  because system will not allow access to low-level so.<br />
<br />
 I will make system memory corrupt and as we all know that this system have ability to solve this problem this I will make system to jump.................or I will use a techinique HVHR(Half Virtual Half Real) I will make some part of system in my programme 's virtual machine and half of the system real this will make access to processor and then question arises  how I will make  system to work in my HVHR because my programme is running on that system.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
Installer component this will install various components at low-level then reboot it and.....other think you know what I'm thinking<br />
<br />
Problem.2:Sniffers can make sys admins or security researchers know that something malicious is happening.<br />
Solution:<br />
<br />
I already thinked about this problem I will not use any Protocol(s) like IP,TCP,HTTP for accessing C&amp;C.I am coding my own Protocol which is in progress and 25% done....... suggestion are welcome and Since I'm coding my own OS I will like to hear suggestions from you.(Off Topic|Can be ign0red)</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I think by now this is pretty clear to OP that this forum requires more actual realisting stuff then fantasies.<br />
<br />
why i am calling this a fantasy (as every dream or reality of current world was a fantansy in old ages.)<br />
<br />
Those fantasies were realized by the original thinker and acted upon. as of now there is nothing in this idea which is sort of done.<br />
<br />
so i would request @HACKER_ADI to actually build something around this idea and then ask for help or suggestion. coz till we keep only day dreaming nothing can be realized.<br />
<br />
right now these statements are just as vague as it can go<br />
<br />
we will access Microprocessor <br />
Increase the voltage to bomb the computer or make short-circuit<br />
hijack short-circuit breaker<br />
 shutdown the Security Systems<br />
I will make system memory corrupt<br />
I will use a techinique HVHR(Half Virtual Half Real)<br />
I am coding my own Protocol which is in progress and 25% done<br />
I'm coding my own OS <br />
<br />
<br />
now even before you start on all this i will point out why people have  not take you seriously.<br />
1) try to get an understanding on how electronic circuits work. how is a normal power circuit seperated from your OS / Processor stack. <br />
2) how pc attaches in the whole power grid circuit<br />
3) circuit breakers and how to control them or is it even under control of a pc.<br />
4) when you are sayin wrting my own protocol (good that you are doing it. however keep in mind it will not be security it will be security by obsecurity)<br />
5) for OS same goes as above.</blockquote>

I just know that that person is not you because he cant be soooooo irrational. even in dreams and even while he has consumed all the available alcohol.<br />

He may want to come out and disclose his studies as now would be the best time :)<br />

bdw, do u think this would be possible with laptops running on battery power?<br />

</div>Nobody is laughing at you or stopping you from dreaming. All we are saying is that do some research on your area of interest and realise your dream(however impossible it might be) . But while posting your ideas do some prior research about it before posting. It is good to dream , btw!</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">First of all you are not the only one to think about this. If you remember last malcon they had reward for a malware if it can damage a hardware.<br />
I would not go into stuxnet because that is totally different picture. Since PLC of that catagory are made with the purpose to control Hardware with software.<br />
So if we can send signals to this software or hardware underneath it we can control hardware. In case of PLC access hardware through software is already taken care of.<br />
BUT this doesnt mean we can access the direct hardware of the PC, even stuxnet couldn't access the other PC hardware.<br />
There is no direct software access to the power circuits of the PC. <br />
<br />
Yes lots of people have this crazy idea, I even I wanted to work on one particular code which might damage CPU. <br />
But I am in to hibernate mode due to some real life reasons.<br />
<br />
Even I have herd from a friend about code which can damage old intel Microprocessor he said he has seen it and show it if willing to pay for damage :-) hahahha<br />
So I was curious if it could be done with latest intel processors also ? But sadly I am not getting time for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also like to add on to Anant's points<br />
<br />
4) when you are sayin wrting my own protocol (good that you are doing it. however keep in mind it will not be security it will be security by obsecurity)<br />
<br />
-Writing protocol for understanding is good but writing protocol for hiding something is not good idea. Rather using encryption wouldn't be simpler and efficient ?<br />
<br />
5) for OS same goes as above. <br />
- Just saying you are making your OS doesnt make any sense. What type of OS you are making and what inputs you require from others ?</blockquote>
