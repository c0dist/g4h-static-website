I am a manual tester with some automation experience, and like many others quite frustrated with my career. I would like to get into info sec field, especially web app pen testing. I have started some course in cybrary but I think I need to study in some institute that can give me a headstart. I know googling and figuring out myself is possibly best way but in my case I really need a full time class room course, as I am unable to focus.<br />
I see isoeh, koenig or lucideus being reviewed as good institutes but not sure whether its true.<br />
It will be nice if senior forum members can point me towards right direction... <br />

</div>I am curious to know what does isoeh, koenig or lucideus say about their course. What did you find interesting in their course? What is the duration of course?<br />

</div>they all claim to teach ethical hacking, I have not gone beyond their own claim or compared their material. My overall impression is koenig is pretty expensive and aimed at foreign students. Since I am new to the field I wont be able to do a side by side comparison. The course duration is not mentioned for isoeh, or koenig but lucideus one is 80 hours.<br />
I dont know how good these institutions are, if anybody knows better institutions in Delhi or Bangalore, I will get in touch.</blockquote>

I would have recommended such course if claimed - learn hacking in 8 years!<br />

</div>When you know the truth, whom are you trying to escape from :) There is no alternate way to learn dude! Either relish the pain or forget it. This field is not for those who need external force to drive.<br />

</div>thanks, I have seen your thread, and it seems to be a very good certification. If I cannot find a classroom course myself I would probably do that(or do it anyway afterwards). I presume the learning curve is pretty steep at the beginning which is why I am trying to take shortcut. :)</blockquote>
