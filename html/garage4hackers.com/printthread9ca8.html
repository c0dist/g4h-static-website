		<blockquote class="restore">Relying on a simple user ID and password is fraught with peril. That’s where two-factor authentication services come into play. <br/>
<br/>
SMS two-factor authentication is safer than traditional login methods, Using the SMS or OTP method, whenever two-factor authentication is enabled and required, the user logs in with a user ID and password. The secured service sends a text message containing the required code or password to the user’s mobile phone, and the user must re-enter this information through the login screen in order to complete verification.<br/>
<br/>
Presumably, only someone who knows the user’s ID and password and also possess the user’s mobile device can perform this second verification step, so this helps prevent brute force attacks against the login server.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite the fact that security experts have widely encouraged users and developers to enable and use this method, it remains highly vulnerable to attack.<br/>
SIM card vulnerabilities provide more opportunities for attackers to steal SMS or OTP codes. There are “man-in-the-middle” attacks, which are a variation on simpler malware approaches. These attacks use malware to trick users into visiting a counterfeit website that is designed to appear identical to the real website that the users intend to visit. The user unwittingly enters the user ID and password combination into the fake website, and the counterfeit site actually connects to the real website and sends the credentials. The real website then sends the user a text message with the required verification code or password, and the user unknowingly enters this information using the fake login screen. The counterfeit website then forwards this information to the real website, which authenticates the user and grants access. The attacker forwards the user to the real website, and everything appears to be normal to the user, but the attacker now has the user’s credentials and can have full access to the user’s account.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To avoid SMS vulnerabilities in two-factor authentication, some developers have turned to QR codes as a way to verify user identity without relying on SMS text messages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Use QR codes as a basis for verifying user identity. During the login process, the user enters a user ID but not a password. But the user must then use a mobile device to scan a QR code that is shown on the login screen. On the mobile device, the QR scanning app contains a randomly generated secret code that is used as a unique identifier. This code or private key is used to sign or encrypt the QR code that is scanned, and when the user scans the QR code, the app can confirm possession of the required private key and confirm identity.<br/>
<br/>
The QR code method uses public key cryptography, which is an ideal approach to two-factor authentication, but please note it also places a burden on the user in requiring a successful scan of the QR code. Many users have difficulties with scanning QR codes, and this can be a time-consuming that delays logins.</blockquote>
