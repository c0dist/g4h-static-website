Introduction</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">The Basic to In-depth Home Computer Security Guide is intended to prescribe basic countermeasures to the home computer users working with computer systems running Windows Operating System<b>. </b>The basic purpose of this document is to create awareness about Computer Security issues among home computer users and suggest them the tasks to be performed to secure their computer systems to protect their information assets.</font><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  Information security needs have to be addressed at all levels, from the individual user to an organization and beyond that to the government and the nation. Information Security is becoming synonymous with National Security as Computer Networking, which is vulnerable to Cyber attacks, forms the backbone of critical infrastructure of the country banking, power, communication network etc. It is, therefore, important to have secured Computer Systems and Networks. <br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
  Also, increased focus on outsourcing of IT and other services from developed countries is bringing the issue of data security to the fore. Furthermore, owing to the massive Internet boom, a lot of home users with little or no prior knowledge with the threats and their countermeasures are exposed to the Internet. This, the attacker, can exploit to expand their base of malicious activity and use innocent people for their schemes. Our aim to spread the education to school children, teachers, parents, senior citizens &amp; every Individual to equip them with the knowledge needed to mitigate the threat.<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">Why Home Computers?</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  Home computers are typically not very secure and are easy to break-in. When combined with high-speed Internet connections that are always turned on, intruders can quickly find and then attack home computers. While intruders also attack home computers connected to the Internet through dial-in connections, high-speed connections (cable modems and DSL modems) are a favorite target. There may not be important data stored on the home computers but they are targeted by the intruders for launching attack against other computer systems.<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">How attackers do it?</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="#292526">In general, attack vectors which attackers use are :</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="#292526"><span style="font-family: SymbolMT">• </span></font><font color="#292526">Through E-mail</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="#292526"><span style="font-family: SymbolMT">• </span></font><font color="#292526">Through Un-trusted Websites</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="#292526"><span style="font-family: SymbolMT">• </span></font><font color="#292526">Through Internet Shares</font><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  In some cases, they send email with a virus. Reading that email activates the virus, creating an opening that intruders use to enter or access the computer. In other cases, they take advantage of a flaw or weakness in one of the computer program’s vulnerability – to gain access. Once they’re on the computer, they often install new programs that let them continue to use the computer – even after user plug the holes they used to get onto user’s computer in the first place. These are known as “backdoors” and are usually cleverly disguised so that they blend in with the other programs running on user’s computer. <br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
  In general, they steal the information saved by the user on his system or use the system to launch attack on other computer systems.<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">What is Information Security?</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  Information security can be explained by the help of following example. If company sells bottled water purified using the process of reverse osmosis, the process is well known, and therefore it does not make good business sense for management to protect that information. However, if that company has a revolutionary process that cuts the cost and time for water purification in half, it would make sense to secure that information. There is a limit to the value of implementing protection so user must combine his knowledge of value, threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to put together a feasible plan.<br/>
  <br/>
  Information security involves the measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information processed by and stored in a computer or system.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <b><i><font color="black">Confidentiality: </font></i></b><i><font color="black">Ensures that information is accessed only by authorized personnel.</font></i><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <b><i><font color="black">Integrity: </font></i></b><i><font color="black">Ensures that information is modified only by authorized personnel.</font></i><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <b><i><font color="black">Availability: </font></i></b><i><font color="black">Ensures that information and systems can be accessed when needed by authorized personnel.</font></i><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  This practice include policies, procedures, hardware and software tools necessary to protect the computer systems and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the systems.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  When the user combines efforts to provide data confidentiality, data integrity, and data availability with physical security, then he can provide a very effective security solution.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore"><b><b><span style="font-family: &amp;quot">Importance of Cyber Security</span></b></b><br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
  Cyber security is important for the users because they have to protect themselves against identity theft. Organizations including government also need this security to protect their trade secrets, financial information, and some sensitive or critical data. Since all sensitive information that is mostly stored on a computer that is connected to the Internet, there is a need for information assurance and security. So in order to have Cyber Security, everyone should follow the Cyber Security standards that enable us to protect various Malware threats. A poor Cyber security practice arises because of some of the following reasons. Poor administrative practices of application, poor software coding which may be vulnerable and improper usage of Cyber Security practices.<br/>
  <br/>
   <br/>

  <br/>
  <i><font color="black">A threat, for information security, is any activity that represents possible danger to user’s information.</font></i><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">Intruders want the information stored by the users which are personal and sensitive, such as credit card numbers, PINs, passwords etc. By stealing this information the malicious intruders commonly referred to hackers may gain financially. The intruders also use the resources of the compromised systems for their own purposes and for attacking other computer systems connected to the Internet. Recent trends in computer security threats show that the attackers are compromising the home computers and installing malicious code such as Bots in these systems, which may then be used as Zombies to further launch large scale attacks on critical information systems. This type of attack is known as</font> <font color="black">Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS).</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">Vulnerabilities in home computer</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  A vulnerability is a weakness in user’s information security that could be exploited by a threat; that is, a weakness in user’s system and network security, processes, and procedures.<br/>
  <br/>
  Computer vulnerability is flaw in the computer system. Which when exploited allows intruder to compromise the system’s integrity. The common types of vulnerabilities are logical errors in operating system or applications due to poor coding techniques, allowing intruder to exploit them and giving him heightened access to the user’s computer. Various security tools are available to secure the system like firewalls etc. These tools provide excellent security mechanism but having flaw in design that could lead to security breach. The term “security through obscurity” fits into this arena, being the system is secure because nobody can see hidden elements. All types of file encryption come under this category. By means of encrypting the data an additional layer of protection is being added to the computer system. In case a system is compromised, the critical data is still protected by encryption. And the intruder may not be able to steal the <font color="black">information from the hacked system.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">What is Intrusion?</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">The users of home computers normally connect to internet through dial-in modems or internet connection through cable. Intruders are always looking for new ways to break into computers connected to internet. They may attempt to breach the computer security defenses from remote locations. Intruders seek old, unpatched vulnerabilities as well as newly discovered vulnerabilities in operating systems, network services, or protocols</font><font color="black">1 </font><font color="black">and take advantage of each. They develop and use sophisticated automated programs to rapidly penetrate the systems, alive on the Internet. Once the attacker is able to find a vulnerable system, he exploits the system to steal information or to launch further attacks.</font><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<b><font color="black">Indications of Infection</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <font color="black">Some of the indications are given below:</font><br/>
<br/>
  <font color="black"><span style="font-family: SymbolMT">• </span></font><font color="black">Poor system performance</font><br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black"><span style="font-family: SymbolMT">• </span></font><font color="black">Abnormal system behavior e.g. system restarts or hangs frequently.</font><br/>

  <br/>
  Key loggers are software application (or hardware based as well) which are able to capture the key logging events and can mail them to remote intruder via email. These are invisible and undetectable to users so there is a huge risk of sending important information such as credit card numbers passwords to the remote intruders.

  <font size="3"><b><font color="black">Bots</font></b></font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">The term Bot is derived from the word “Robot”. Robot comes from the Czech word "robot," which means "worker". In computer world Bot is a generic term used to describe an automated process.</font><br/>
  <br/>
<font color="black"><br/>
</font><br/>
  <font color="black">Bots are being used widely on the Internet for various purposes. Bot functionality may vary from search engines to game bots and IRC channel bots.Google bot is one such famous search bot, which crawls through the web pages on the net to collect information and build database to enable variety of searches. Computer controlled opponents and enemies in multiple player video games are also a kind of bot, where the computer process tries to emulate the human behavior.</font><br/>
  <br/>
<font color="black"><br/>
</font><br/>
  However, the usage of bots is not limited to good purpose only. Bots are widely used to perform malicious activities ranging from information stealing to using as a launching pad for distributed attack. Such software’s gets installed on user’s computer without their knowledge. Some bot infected machines, pass the control of the machine to a remote attacker and act as per the attackers command.<br/>

  <font color="black">Such machines are popularly known as zombie machines.</font><br/>

  <font size="3"><b><font color="black">Adware and Spyware</font></b></font><br/>
  <br/>
  Adware is 'freeware', whereby ads are embedded in the program. These ads will show up whenever user opens the program. Most adware authors provide the free version with ads and a registered version whereby the ads are disabled.<br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">As such, the users have the choice, either to use the freeware with ads served or purchase the registered version.</font><br/>

  <br/>
<font color="black"><br/>
</font><br/>
  <font color="black">Spyware, however, is published as 'freeware' or as 'adware', but the fact that an analysis and tracking program (the 'spyware' agent, which reports user’s activities to the advertising providers' web site for storage and analysis) is also installed on user’s system when a user install this so-called 'freeware', and this is usually not mentioned. Even though the name may indicate so, spyware is not an illegal type of software. But what the adware and spyware providers do with the collected information and what they're going to 'feed' the user with, is beyond his control. And in some cases it all happens without the user’s consent.</font><br/>

  <b>Symptoms that we Can Observe When a System is Infected by Spyware are</b><br/>
   <br/>
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings">§  </span>A number of pop up windows while browsing Internet.<br/>
   <br/>
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings">§  </span> Redirection to other website without our control.<br/>
   <br/>
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings">§  </span>Search engines, we use in the browser may get replaced with the other ones.<br/>
   <br/>
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings">§  </span>We notice new tool bars present on the web browser.<br/>
   <br/>

 <b>What is a Rootkit?</b><br/>
  <br/>
The term rootkit is used to describe the mechanisms and techniques whereby malware, including viruses, spyware, and trojans, attempt to hide their presence from spyware blockers, antivirus, and system management utilities. There are several rootkit classifications depending on whether the malware survives reboot and whether it executes in user mode or kernel mode.<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Types of Rootkit</u></b><br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<ul><li style=""><b>Persistent Rootkits</b></li></ul><br/>
  A persistent rootkit is one associated with malware that activates each time the system boots. Because such malware contain code that must be executed automatically each system start or when a user logs in, they must store code in a persistent store, such as the Registry or file system, and configure a method by which the code executes without user intervention.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<ul><li style=""><b>Memory-Based Rootkits</b></li></ul><br/>
  Memory-based rootkits are malware that has no persistent code and therefore does not survive a reboot.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore"><ul><li style=""><b>User-mode Rootkits</b></li></ul><br/>
  There are many methods by  which rootkits attempt to evade detection. For example, a user-mode  rootkit might intercept all calls to the Windows  FindFirstFile/FindNextFile APIs, which are used by file system  exploration utilities, including Explorer and the command prompt, to  enumerate the contents of file system directories. When an application  performs a directory listing that would otherwise return results that  contain entries identifying the files associated with the rootkit, the  rootkit intercepts and modifies the output to remove the entries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  The Windows native API serves as the interface between user-mode  clients and kernel-mode services and more sophisticated user-mode  rootkits intercept file system, Registry, and process enumeration  functions of the Native API. This prevents their detection by scanners  that compare the results of a Windows API enumeration with that returned  by a native API enumeration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<ul><li style=""><b>Kernel-mode Rootkits</b></li></ul><br/>
  Kernel-mode rootkits  can be even more powerful since, not only can they intercept the native  API in kernel-mode, but they can also directly manipulate kernel-mode  data structures. A common technique for hiding the presence of a malware  process is to remove the process from the kernel's list of active  processes. Since process management APIs rely on the contents of the  list, the malware process will not display in process management tools  like Task Manager or Process Explorer.<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

</font>The rootkit installs a backdoor giving the hacker a full  control of the computer. It hides their files, registry keys, and  process names, and network connections from your eyes. Your antivirus  could not detect such programs because they use compression and  encryption of its files. UnHackMe allows you to detect and remove  Rootkits.<br/>

  <br/>
  <font color="black">To ensure that the information is secured during process, storage and transmission certain security measures are to be taken by the users of that information.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  Following sections will describe certain tasks that are to be performed by the user to secure the computer systems being used at home and information stored or processed therein.<br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">These tasks broadly involve steps to prevent computer security incidents.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">The Defense in Depth Approach for the Home User</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  A defense in depth strategy is the traditional one adopted to afford the defended area the strongest and most resilient protection. In the case of the home Internet user, the defended area is the user’s data. As shown in Figure 1, defense in depth for the home user consists of defensive measures adopted in four layers, namely: network access; the operating system; user applications; and data. At the center of the defended area is the most valued component of the defended area – the user’s data.<br/>
  <br/>
<u><a href="http://imageshack.com/photo/my-images/46/figure1.png/" target="_blank">http://img46.imageshack.us/i/figure1.png</a></u><a href="http://imageshack.com/photo/my-images/46/figure1.png/" target="_blank">http://img46.imageshack.us/i/figure1.png</a><br/>
<br/>

</a><br/>
  <br/>
<font size="3"><b><font color="black">Attacks Defensive Layers</font></b></font><br/>
  <br/>
  Figure-1: Most common Intruder methods used against home computers This layered approach is required since even the most expensive firewall controlling network access cannot effectively control traffic content. For example, most firewalls will allow an e-mail attachment containing viruses. These viruses may be cleaned at the operating system layer by anti-virus software if they are recognized. However, if they are of an unknown type, then the final defense is at the data layer where the user opens the e-mail attachment with care. Apart from <font color="black">this, user data is protected by means of rights &amp; privileges and encryption techniques.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">To be effective, defensive measures at each layer must be based on the threats to the defended area. The recommended defensive measures at each layer of the defense vary as shown in Figure 2.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">Of course home user should consult their system support personnel for advice.</font><br/>
<br/>
  <font size="3"><br/>

<br/>
<font color="black">Figure-2: Defense in Depth – Defensive Actions at each layer</font><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">The defensive actions have been identified at each layer, it is necessary to discuss how these actions  will  be  carried out  for  a Windows-based home Internet user. It  is  also</div></div>  <font color="black">important to keep in mind that  the defensive posture is weakened  when one  does  not</font><br/>
  <font color="black">implement the entire defense  in depth strategy that is being advocated.  For  example,</font><br/>
  <font color="black">using a firewall but having either no or outdated antivirus software, leaves the system</font><br/>
  <font color="black">vulnerable.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b><font color="black">Defensive Measures at Network Access Layer</font></b><br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first layer of the defense in depth model. The defensive measures that have to be taken at this layer are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <font color="black">Use a Firewall.</font><br/>
  <br/>
<font color="black"><br/>
</font><br/>
  <font color="black">Disconnect from the Internet when not using it.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <font size="3"><b><font color="black">Use a Firewall</font></b></font><br/>
  <br/>
  A firewall places a virtual barrier between the computer and hackers, who might seek to delete information from the computer, make it crash, or even steal personal information.<br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">The firewall serves as the primary defense against a variety of computer worms that are transmitted over the network. It helps to protect the computer by hiding it from external users and preventing unauthorized connections to the computer.</font><br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">For home users, a firewall typically takes one of two forms:</font><br/>
  <br/>
  Personal firewall - specialized software running on an individual computer, e.g.  ZoneAlarm and in-built Windows Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) etc.<br/>
  <br/>
  Hardware firewall - a separate device designed to protect one or more computers, e.g. Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router.<br/>
  <br/>
  <font color="black">If user is having a home network, it is recommended that he should have both types of firewall installed i.e. hardware firewall at the router</font><font color="black">3 </font><font color="black">and personal firewall at each system using that network. But if the user is using a stand-alone PC only, then it is recommended that he should have at least a personal firewall installed on the PC.</font></blockquote>
