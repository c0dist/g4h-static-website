The most simple way:  use  third party interface to crack  WIFI, whcih is called  the first step to break our village WIFI. In order to facilitate the application in the actual scene,I put all the operations on the phone as possible .The first step,  WarDriving collect  WIFI information, tools download address: <a href="https://wigle.net/tools" target="_blank">https://wigle.net/tools</a>, this tool can collect WIFI SSID, BSSID and GPS, then  export CVs and KML file , use Google earth  open the KML file,  finally, the map will mark the WIFI information, as shown below:<br />

The second step, to break the third party interface, I started to use WIFI master key interface to batch break, but the software updates, the former interface is unusable. To reverse this software, in the reverse process, I found a more simple method, <a href="http://www.wifi4.cn/" target="_blank">http://www.wifi4.cn/</a> this website is used to check whether the WIFI password leak or not, it is achieved through some third party WIFI sharing APP interface , but it is  made restrictions on the number of queries, as follows:<br />

<br />
To analyze capture pocket,  it use  JavaScript to limit 12 number of  WIFI, and no limit on the number of back-end. What is more,  the returned  results have made Duplicate removal on the WIFI data. we can use this interface to all one-time collection of the WIFI in the query interface code. I have written the code address: <a href="https://dazhouzhou.github.io/code/crack.py" target="_blank">https://dazhouzhou.github.io/code/crack.py</a> Now we can use a mobile phone to try to test the WIFI security, the specific operation of the video  as below:<br />
