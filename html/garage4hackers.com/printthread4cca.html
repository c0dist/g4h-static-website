		<blockquote class="restore">This documentation is about a successful attack Strategy  on something which I was trying out form last 15 days. It all started with silent-poison handing over to me a webshell, "a non interactive .php shell" on a webserver the shell was having NT-Authority System privileges. He did a good work there, as I was told he used a joomal exploit to get that shell up running. And it was obviously a high priority webserver .He should probably document that part :).<br/>
<br/>
The issue he was facing was that he was not able to back connect nor use bind shell to get an interactive command prompt. Well yes it would be definitely be because of a proxy/Firewall/Nating issues. <br/>
<br/>
Day 1:<br/>
<br/>
All I am having is a web shell with privileges to execute commands, it was a windows 2008 serevr . I started by doing an external nmap <br/>

</div>No filtered ports  but just an open port,as normally if firewalled windows RPC ports would be filtered .Himm should be a Router ACL configured with no outbound connections and Only allow inbound connection on port 80<br/>
<br/>
For confirming I uploaded a command line port-scanner, not nmap as I am not having interactive command prompt and configuring namp+wincap on non interactive setup is hard so dint wanted to take that pain.  <br/>
<br/>

So problem maker is a cisco Ios firewall . So I have to bypass this one to get an interactive shell Rdp,commd prompt etc.  And the question is how ??<br/>
<br/>
Day 2<br/>
<br/>
It took two days to build an option set<br/>
<br/>
[+]Few solutions I could think about was <br/>
[1]Get access to firewall by Brute-forcing password or some other means modify the acess list to.<br/>
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Code:</div>
	<hr/><code class="bbcode_code">access-list 101 permit tcp any host 171.16.23.1 eq 3389</code><hr/>
</div> [Hard?impossible form a non interactive shell ] And bruteforce program and all I ill have to code in native C/C++ which I wasn't that fast in doing [I am in love with python :)]<br/>
<br/>
[2] Find another system in the network which might have internet acess like Mail serevr Dns servers hack them then tunnel firewalled machines traffic and take it out to the internet and get interactive shell. <br/>
<br/>
[3] DNS tunneling and Port reuse <a href="../www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-08/Miller/BH_US_08_Ty_Miller_Reverse_DNS_Tunneling_Shellcode.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.blackhat.com/presentation..._Shellcode.pdf</a> Metsploit got DNs tunneling payloads. "You cant achieve fully interactive shell"<br/>
<br/>
And from these I choose the second option. So now I have to spot system with which might have direct internet access. <br/>

Fiar enough so now this is would be the target to hack. A quick looking up also revealed that target mail server was also there Domain controller :D how stupid is that. And what the point in putting a firewall in front off web server and not doing anything to this Mail/Domain server, Sad but good for me.<br/>

Nmaps Smb bruter module gives good results. So that if I could crack an account then I could use it to excute commands using Pstools<br/>

I did little more pocking around with the mail server found out the snmb community string was public only used Snmpenum, listed updates and checked if any was missiing, that too dint worked.<br/>

<br/>
[+] Plan 1,2,3 flopped for me so need to make a new plan <br/>
[-] Curent scenario is the Nating is taking place in the Cisco firewall where connections are forwarded to internal Ip and Cisco ACL is configured in such a way that.<br/>
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Code:</div>
	<hr/><code class="bbcode_code">access-list 101 permit tcp any host 171.16.23.1 eq 80<br/>
--&gt; allows connection on port 80 <br/>
access-list 101 deny tcp any host 171.16.23.1 eq any<br/>
--&gt; deny any other connections on any other port</code><hr/>
</div>You could read a good doc abt ACLs here <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_configuration_example09186a0080100548.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk64...80100548.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
[-]So connections to port 80 would be accepted and forwarded to internal computer. As the Webserevr running Apache is using port 80 we cant bind a port on the 'inused' port .<br/>

			Stupid Most Idea
			
		<hr/>
	</div>
</div>We cant use  port 80 as its been used by apache but if we could shut down apache and make a Command bind shell on port 80 then we could simply telnet to the server and get an interactive command prompt, firewall wont even say a word :cool:. <br/>
<br/>
Well my idea was dump but if that would satisfy my needs then that would be all enough. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Setting up the plan</b><br/>
1)  Make a bind shell using metsploit bind to internal machines Ip on port 80<br/>
2) Make another program which will kill http and call our bind shell and loop through the process so that we wont loose control over web shell.<br/>
3) Make sure that my plan is working fine, by testing/verifying it on local machine. If anything goes wrong then we will end up with nothing.<br/>
4) And also excute the plan only at midnight when no traffice to that web server is there, verify that with netsta -a and do accordingly <br/>
<br/>
[+] A small code to do stuff was built <br/>

 As I already had made the list of alive IPs using foundstone scan line on the very first days itself, segregated the Ips list and passed them to nessus and nmap.<br/>
<br/>
<b>16th Day that was yesterday</b><br/>
Owned 4 more servers inside using three different exploits.<br/>
I am not going in detail about those stuffs coz am tired writing + you could google about them. Or will detail abt Jboss exploit in some other article.<br/>
1) ms08-067 used a public version of the code<br/>
2) Jboss console was there on another win 2008 server 0wned that too.<br/>
<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ASPATCH-126?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Achangehistory-tabpanelhttps://issues.jboss.org/browse/ASPATCH-126?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Achangehistory-tabpanel" target="_blank">https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ASPA...story-tabpanel</a><br/>
3) Microsoft Windows SMB Shares Unprivileged Access<br/>
4)Password brute fore Admin@ip worked on another machine too.<br/>

I was hacking like a mad ass for the last 15 days. Though my primary target inside was a CISCO VOSM surveillance camera management server, I could not reach there. It was a linux machine and am not that good remotely exploiting linux.<br/>
<br/>
 And today I got a confirmation form Null Con folks confirming that my paper on "Penetration testing Biometric system " was selected so had to work on that and wont be able to continue with this one . So just taught of documenting the work so it will save some one Else's time in places where I lagged. <br/>
<br/>
And am thanking all the good fellow hackers of Garage4hackers and others whom I bugged these days asking my doubts, who all helped me out in circumstances  .<br/>
B0nd,Eberly,wipu,webd3vil,sagar.belure,vinnu and <br/>
greetz to garage members : silenpoison(special one for starting it), w4ri0r,empty,neo,Rohith,Sids786,d4rkest,SmartKD,Ti  a,h@xor,Atul,prasant,micro,nishant. <br/>
And obviously to my sweet girl friend who calls me busy geek and knows that am not a good BF, but still loves me .<br/>
<br/>
I always add this greetz part to wht ever I post :)<br/>
