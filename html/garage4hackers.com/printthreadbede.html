<br />
Due to lack of documentation and 'NO tuts available'-state of cpp for web apps, it is difficult for me to understand , per say, security aspects.<br />
Facebook is using Hiphop PHP which has made it far more superior in handling so many requests, further after Google ditching python for cpp and Java(maybe a rumour but, very famous one) has created a drastic impact too.<br />
There are client enquiries who ask me for the same flavour that Google is using... However, I need to know what are the consequences of using CPP for web app development?<br />
So far by word of mouth I have heard / discussion with developers &quot;while using php, asp, jsp, if compromised, you loose a site and possibly the server... but, when on direct cpp to c compiler, u dont loose website, you loose the entire server.... php jsp = sqli, csrf, etc... cpp = bof because, php goes via and works on diff OSI layer whereas CPP is quicker because, it has complete access to all resources&quot; is this understanding correct?<br />
I want to get into production with CPP for web apps. Hiphop is a good alternative however, people also suggest that it is comparatively not stable enough as cppCMS.<br />
<br />
Please advice.</blockquote>

</div>I agree with your point buddy,<br />
<br />
we should not be blaming technology.<br />
<br />
however at same point there should be a limit on using technology at correct places.<br />
<br />
C/C++ suffers bufferoverflow and pointer related issues coz they are primerily intended for low level / system level task's. java does'nt have pointers as it wanted to be a app language. however the whole point here is use the language which you think is good then don't make a fuss out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
also as far as web app in c, my personal opinion i would like to do that only if i have control over the whole server.<br />
I.E. my app itself is acting as a port 80 listener too... ....</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Thanks Vinnu and Anant. :-)<br />
<br />
However, my main point was about the &quot;best practices&quot;, as Vinnu said, it is developers fault and not technologies.<br />
I agree to it, which is why I am seeking guidance from citizens of Garage to help me with &quot;best practices&quot; like, how to sanitize, what could be done to minimize processing time, whitespaces, etc...</blockquote>
