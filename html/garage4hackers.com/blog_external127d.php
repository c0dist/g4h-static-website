In the month of Dec 2014 <a href="https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2014-12-09/blue-coat-exposes-%E2%80%9C-inception-framework%E2%80%9D-very-sophisticated-layered-malware" target="_blank">BlueCoat</a> released report on APT campaign named ad &quot;Inception&quot;. The spear phishing mail was sent with attachment with various names we analyzed attachment which was named as &quot;Car for sale.doc&quot;. The Attachment was exploit (CVE-2012-0158) with embed VBS and decoy file themed an advertisement of a used car for sale that purportedly originated from Michael Hahne employee at the German Embassy. <br />
For writing this blog our main moto was to automate Extraction of large payload and decoy file used in APT Inception so that it can save time of researchers to extract payloads and possibly new varient of the malware.<br />

I have written an automated script which can process lots of samples which have the same shellcode..<br />
To use create a folder named &quot;scan&quot; and put the sample in it. scan folder and script should be in same directory. <br />
