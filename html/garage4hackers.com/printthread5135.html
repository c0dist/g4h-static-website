Tsunamis, droughts, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes are those natural calamities which are over the control of Human. Each year we witness heavy devastation in some or the other areas around the globe. We lose people, we lose properties &amp; top of all we lose our moral.<br/>
This year, it’s Kashmir, India who’s barring the hammer of nature. This flood has not only hit India but also Pakistan. The death toll has already risen to 200+ in India &amp; 280+ in Pakistan. The damage that has been caused to the properties can not even be counted in numbers for now.<br/>

<br/>
One of our fellow garage member Rashid Bhat is from kashmir[India]. We were able to raise a small amount from the garage admins and now we are reaching out to all garage members out there. The money we have raised was used to buy Medicines, Blankets, Food and other emergency amenities. Rashid himself has gone to kashmir with the aids and he would be returning soon and its our responsibility to provide more support for kashmir . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have seen how great and responsible people were donating/spreading awareness about ALS and. Garage4Hackers<br/>
