		<blockquote class="restore">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
So today I am visiting after a long time. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I thought to share with bhai log, something about my new suicide venture [converting to batman from Harvey Dent, will explain below ;) ]- PWK (pentesting with Kali) formerly known as PWB.<br/>
Some folks know it as OSCP too. Although OSCP is the certification.<br/>
<br/>
Well, so I registered for PWK one month back and really been through hell. <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/say-try-harder/" target="_blank">https://www.offensive-security.com/o...ay-try-harder/</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The hell? Well it is a hell for somebody from non-pentesting background, :p<br/>
I've been studying security for a long time, but never tried hands on. (Even after being advised by b0nd, lol). But you usually will be afraid of going to jail :p<br/>
<br/>
<b>Converting to  batman from Harvey Dent</b>:-<br/>
I usually used to sleep by 11/12. But gotta sleep by 3/4 in night [/morning].<br/>
people literally become a bat during PWK. But U get habitual slowly.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of exploitation and googling. It bloody bugs the mind. U will spend probably 70% time in googling. Get habitual of it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>ADVICE:- </b><br/>
1.    Do lots of practice of exploitation. Now don't just setup your TOR and start banging servers on public internet. :cool: , There are lots of free Labs available on internet.<br/>
2.    Have a good experience of locating correct exploit from searchsploit OR exploit-db OR from ...etc....<br/>
3.    Learn about all att@ck vectors and practice them.<br/>
4.    Try not using metasploit exploits and auxiliary.<br/>
5.    Setup an environment for compiling C and CPP exploits. Most of the exploits get outdated so it is hell of a job to compile.<br/>
6.    Setup the environment to convert .py files to .exe<br/>
7.    Learn cross-compilation and be familiar with GCC, Visual Studio too.<br/>
8.    Learn file uploading and FTPs.<br/>
9.    Learn assembly language to practice Buffer Overflows (must to clear exam).<br/>
10.  PWK is lot about WEB PT, so practice RFI/LFI (Remote/Local file inclusions) etc...<br/>
11.  Practice SQL injection.<br/>
12.  Practice XSS.<br/>
13.  Learn Python/Ruby (Metasploit is written in ruby, so will give a good understanding of what happens in background).<br/>
14.  Learn bash scripting(learning upto level of automated banner grabbing of whole subnet will do).<br/>
15.  And first of all, learn Linux ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else got more advices. Plz post them. I may have missed some(I am not the expert, just trying to provide a guide which I couldn't find on the fly). Lets make it a good point for reference for PWK/OSCP.<br/>
<br/>
C ya... lol.py :o</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Ok, <br/>
<br/>
So I got my LAB expired 2 days back. Looking back, it feels that I learnt alot in LABs.<br/>
After pwning so many boxes I still feel there is a lot to learn yet. So after a break and practicing during this break I'll join the LAB again. There are few boxes I left in student network(coz I don't count the boxes I pwned using metasploit) and also didn't get time to pwn other networks present in LAB (other networks are there for additional practice. If you don't do them, still it is OK).<br/>
<br/>
As per general advice, if you have done all the boxes other than few special ones (like- pain, sufference, humble.. etc..), you are still good to go for exam. But plz note that exam is much much tougher than the LAB. So, try to pwn as much boxes as you can. This includes other hidden networks too.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I learnt in LAB and from other experts' advice is that the LAB is a place to learn, not just to pwn. You need to figure out the correct way in to a machine. And for that you need a lot of research. But, that research only makes you a perfect pen-tester. Lemme explain why:-<br/>
<br/>
1.   There are hundreds and thousands of exploits available for multiple applications and OSs. Multiple exploits keep getting added to exploit-db and at other sites on a daily basis and Off-sec can't teach you all of those things within a span of 2-3 months. So if you are getting into pen-testing field (or if you already are) and you want to be a good pen-tester, you should be able to figure out the correct exploit and pwning method for any heck of given machine. The networks you will face in real pen-testing scenario will be perfectly patched and will seem impossible to break in, but if there is a port there is probably a way in. So keep reminding to yourself of learning.<br/>
<br/>
2.   There will be probabilities when you get tired of trying things and would want a help/hint. Don't go for it as far as possible. Because more you read about vectors and more you research, more you'll gain knowledge (again, don't make pwning your motto, rather make it learning).<br/>
<br/>
3.   There have been times when I researched an attack vector for hours and then at last it turned out to be non-applicable on that particular machine. But, in the end it should be learning that you should care about and go on.<br/>
<br/>
4.   There are more than one methods to pwn a machine. So, more you research, more are your probabilities of success.<br/>
<br/>
Now during the break from LABs I'm going to practice on other freely available LABs available on internet. Recently I got introduced to a perfect place for mastering SQLi:- <br/>
<br/>
1.   <a href="https://github.com/Audi-1/sqli-labs/" target="_blank">https://github.com/Audi-1/sqli-labs/</a><br/>
2.   <a href="http://www.securitytube.net/user/Audi" target="_blank">http://www.securitytube.net/user/Audi</a><br/>
3.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOdrhE67CR8lM0z2-_fe-A" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiO...CR8lM0z2-_fe-A</a><br/>
<br/>
These 3 links are for the same LAB. you can get to know from securitytube's link (<a href="http://www.securitytube.net/video/4171" target="_blank">http://www.securitytube.net/video/4171</a>) about how to setup this LAB in your machine. The best tutorials I found so far for SQLi.<br/>
<br/>
Other sources for practicing WEB-PT can be found on:- <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/individuals" target="_blank">https://pentesterlab.com/individuals</a> . This includes various XSS, LFI/RFI and SQLi (and many more) based ISO's.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I am just a student and no expert, I am just trying to provide some information that I learnt from my experience. There maybe many more experts to provide more valuable information.<br/>
<br/>
Keep learning and keep sharing  :-)</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Are you done with the certification exam? I did OSCP back last year in October, since then they've changed a lot of things for PWK from what I've heard.<br/>
<br/>
Just some points:<br/>
1. If you're stuck at a machine in the labs, focus on recon and info gathering. Google each and everything you find, if you're not familiar with it already.<br/>
2. Pain, sufferance, humble &amp; gh0st are the best machines! :D <br/>
3. If an exploit doesn't get you a shell, look at the errors and just don't give it up after a go, you might need to fix up the exploit a bit before it runs correctly. <br/>
4. Practice BOF's on other applications as well, you can lookup exploits and apps both on EDB. Corelan.be is a very good resource for learning.<br/>
5. There are multiple attack vectors for each machine, so if one is failing, look up other ways to exploit it.<br/>
6. Try to be as less dependent on Metasploit as you can. :)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, keep calm and enjoy the labs cause you're gonna miss it when it gets over. :p<br/>
<br/>

		<blockquote class="restore">Ok, I visited this thread after a long time. Almost forgot it :p<br/>
<br/>
About first exam, it was much miserable. Honestly I could PWN only the box meant for BOF (buffer overflow). Rest other boxes' vulnerabilities were caught after a long struggle. But still some boxes didn't let me get in and some didn't allow rooting. <br/>
<br/>
Slept just for 3 hours. Tried to sleep for more to get some rest but the rush didn't let me sleep. I remember making report about BOF at 3'o clock :cool: . After 16 hours I understood that I need lot more practice &amp; knowledge. But still didn't give up. I stayed in VPN till last moment, trying to PWN some more boxes. But out of nowhere 23.45 hours finished &amp; time up. I didn't expect such a miserable failure.<br/>
<br/>
Later I discussed with a friend (who'd been bug bounty #1 for 2 years) &amp; understood that he too got same kind of setup in exam that made him fail. So, it was some relief to me. It reminded me of 3-idiots dialogue at that time :p <br/>
<br/>
Still I understood lots of mistakes of mine. <br/>
<br/>
#1.   Never group with students when you are doing PWK. Becoz you loose the opportunity to fry your brains with h@ck!ng knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
#2.   Even though it is frustrating in LAB, continue. Accept your failure and practice. Because more you google now, less overwork it guarantees in future.<br/>
<br/>
#3.   LAB is not for pwning. So even if you don't pwn enough boxes in LAB but learn enough, it is good enough.<br/>
<br/>
#4.   No information is useless information. Note every information you get for a box.<br/>
<br/>
#5.   Practice, Practice, Practice &amp; Practice to enumerate. It's all about enumeration.<br/>
<br/>
#6.   For guys like me (from a non-pentesting background), don't be discouraged. Why? Because, it takes time for mindset to change and adopt to a new environment. <br/>
<br/>
Rest later. <br/>
