<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>We start one by one.</b></font><br/>
<br/>
<b><font color="DarkRed">1.Animation-</font></b>Indian animation is increasing day by day as we all can see most of ad makers are using animated characters,slogans,graphics for enhancing their advertisements,movie hoarding till 3d enabled games all are part of animation.the job of animator is to drawing the models/world with creativity and strong enthusiasm.he will come across many of the mathematical complexities in between studies like coords,model programming etc.one should be very creative for choosing this.there are multiple things can be accomplished using animation like game level/model design,website dynamic content development,ad shooting etc.some of the major tools uses in animation is Flash with action script,3D Studio MAX,MAYA 3D,GMAX,Game Factory etc.but again its future concept &amp; will take time to establish fully.the pay scale you can get after this course is around 10-20K per month(depends on the city).various academies are conducting courses like MAYA Academy,toon skools,arena multimedia.<br/>
<br/>
<b><font color="DarkRed">2.programming-</font></b>when it comes to programming,there are lots of area where you can get specializations like C,C++,.Net,Java,Mysql,Oracle/Sybase/DB2 are some of the famous one certs.<br/>
